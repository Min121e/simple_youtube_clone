## About this project

I built this using reactjs for development and Material UI to style it. I had to look up the whole MUI documentation to do this since I normally use tailwind to style my projects. I used Axios to fetch the api from RapidAPI. Due to the limitations of the free version of the YouTube API on RapidAPI, users can watch up to 500 videos per day.
